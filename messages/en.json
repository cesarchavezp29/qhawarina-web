    "subtitle": "Democratizing access to real-time economic information for all Peruvians",
    "origin": {
      "title": "How was Qhawarina born?",
      "question": "Why do Peruvians have to wait weeks or months to know how our economy is doing?",
      "story1": "In 2024, while analysts at investment banks and international organizations had access to sophisticated economic nowcasting models, the average Peruvian—the entrepreneur in Gamarra, the farmer in Ayacucho, the student planning their future—navigated with outdated information.",
      "story2": "We believe economic information is a public good. Qhawarina exists to level the playing field: use the same technology employed by large investment funds, but put it at the service of everyone, for free, with complete transparency."
    },
    "meaning": {
      "title": "What does \"Qhawarina\" mean?",
      "etymology": "Qhawarina comes from the Quechua \"qhaway\" (to watch, to observe) with the suffix \"-rina\" (instrument for). Literally: \"instrument for watching\" or \"place from which to observe\".",
      "metaphor": "Like the traditional qhawarina—a lookout in the heights from which the territory is watched—our project offers a panoramic, anticipatory, and clear view of the Peruvian economy.",
      "quote": "From the heights of the Andes, ancient Peruvians observed the territory to anticipate harvests, weather, movements. Today, from our digital qhawarina, we observe the economy to anticipate trends before they arrive."
